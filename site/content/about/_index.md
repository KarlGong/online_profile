As an anthropologist and a writer, I explore the beliefs, behaviors, stories and journeys that shape us. I have more than ten years of experience in consumer research, global ethnography and narrative non-fiction writing. 

I’ve work extensively in areas crossing education, entertainment, insurance, home appliance, health wellness and digital interface design. My qualitative research skill set includes: Ethnography, Digital Ethnography, Participatory design, Focus Groups, One on one in-depth interviews and Usability Testing. 

Currently I’m working at Touch which is a design research consultancy I co-founded in Shanghai China in 2016. Touch aims to connect global business to Chinese consumers with research expertise.
