As an anthropologist and a writer, I explore the beliefs, behaviors, stories and journeys that shape us. I have a decade of experience in consumer research, global ethnography and narrative non-fiction writing. 

I’ve work extensively in areas crossing education, entertainment, insurance, home appliance, health wellness and digital design. My qualitative research skill  includes ethnography, Digital Ethnography, Participatory design, Focus Groups, One on one in-depth interviews and Usability Testing. 

Currently I’m working at Touch Innovation which is a design research consultancy I co-founded in Shanghai China in 2016. Touch aims to connect global creatives with Chinese consumers through research expertise. If you are interested in any collaborations or knowing more about me, please feel free to contact  via caichenyi@gmail.com.
