## Background

Space NK was born in UK, as a boutique beauty house, with a pharmaceutical touch to the brand image, famous for its signature concept design space all over the world. Before opening retail stores in more China cities, Space NK Apothecary needs to identify its Chinese “soul” for a long-term strategy which includes all the online platform setup, online marketing, product selection, logo, name, service supply, and with a focus of materializing the brand image to its retail space design.

## Challenges

Fashion and makeup brands targeting 21-35 years old Chinese young females often have to take some time to understand ‘beauty’ in a cultural and social context, as the meanings are always rapidly changing. Keywords such as aesthetics, lifestyle and aspiration can have new implications once every few months. It’s a matter of speed and willingness how brands look to catch up the social value.\
The concept of beauty in China has evolved beyond the level of a visual perception, but to empower women to achieve peace on a sensual and more over a spiritual way. These lifestyle trends guide the young generation to look for added value behind a brand story.
