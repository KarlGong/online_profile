  - title: Background
    body: >-
      Nature, the worldly famous scientific publishing group, has long built its
      profound reputation in the academic and research field in China. While
      digital age has made big impacts and fostered connection in the Chinese
      scientific research field, Nature groups felt like falling behind in the
      digital scene especially by playing in the social media.  With the rapid
      growing B2B service sales requests, Nature group is looking to maintain
      and boost its online visitors and enhance customer relationships by means
      of digital marketing with the right content strategy.
  - title: Achievements
    body: >-
      The research findings are presented to more than 50 designers from the
      Nature global design team. Stories of external factor and sets of user
      personas are illustrated to make designers get familiar with social
      context of user needs which leads to redesigning the content strategy and
      UX improvements.  A part of strategy is to do target marketing which is to
      produce sets of contents for difficult groups of B2B and B2C users.
